<h3>1: Select a program that can create SVG's</h3>
Scalable Vector Graphics can be created using any vector graphics software. Two major types include Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. Inkscape is free and can be downloaded from their website. Adobe Illustrator is not free, but it offers more tools for more advanced SVG creation. Listed below are the links to their websites:

</ul>
<h3>2: Choose an image to create</h3>
Open your chosen vector graphics software and begin creating your image. You can either create the picture from your imagination, or trace over an existing image. If you choose to trace an image, simply copy the picture and paste it into the program. For this tutorial we will be tracing the X-Wing image in Inkscape.

<h3>3: Trace the image using paths</h3>
Before tracing the image, be sure to create a new layer beneath the copied picture. Also, make sure the opacity of the copied picture is around 50% so you can see your paths. Select the "Draw Bezier curves and straight lines" tool or press Shift + F6. Then proceed to trace the image using that tool. The paths created can be edited using the "Edit paths by nodes" tool or by pressing F2. Try to outline shapes that will use have different colors, this will make the next step easier.

<h3>4: Fill traced areas with color</h3>
After the image has been traced to your liking, it's time to fill it with color! This can be done by selecting the outlined shapes, and choosing which color to fill it with on the side options. As seen in the picture below, the red rectangle has been selected and the color has been filled with red. There are three tabs on the right side. The fill tab will change the color inside the selected outline, the stroke paint tab will change the color of the path, and the stroke style will change the size of the path.

Congratulations, you just created an SVG image. Sometimes it can be difficult to bend the paths to your will, but it will be easier once you create more.
