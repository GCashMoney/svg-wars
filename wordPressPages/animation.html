<h3>1: Open your SVG image in a text editor</h3>
An SVG image can be animated using a variety of languages, but for this tutorial we will be using CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. First, we will need to get the html code of the SVG image. We can do this by opening the SVG image in a text editor. Here are some free text editors available for use:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.1.html">Notepad++</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
</ul>
Simply right-click the SVG image and open it with the text editor. For this tutorial we will be using Notepad++. Your SVG image should look something like this in the program.

<h3>2: Put the HTML and CSS in CodePen</h3>
For this tutorial, we will be using CodePen in order to test our animation. Create a profile on their home website and choose to create a new pen. Copy all of the HTML code in your SVG file and paste it in the HTML zone. Your pen should look something like this except without the CSS code:

<h3>3: Edit the HTML and CSS</h3>
Next, go through the HTML and begin changing things to find out which parts affect the paths of the image. CodePen allows the project to be a playground, so don't be afraid to go wild! You can change or add id's to the paths in order to add styles through CSS. The image below shows how the id "fillred" connects the HTML and CSS. The styles within the "fillred" id will fill animate filling the outline with color.

<h3>4: Create a new SVG file with the new HTML and CSS</h3>
While a SVG image can be animated with styles from another file, the styles can be included within the file itself so you do not have to refer to another location. Open the SVG file in a text editor, then copy the HTML from CodePen and paste all of it over the content of the SVG. Next, copy the CSS and paste it in the location shown below. Note that "&lt;![CDATA[" needs to come before the CSS and "]]&gt;" at the end.

And that concludes this short tutorial! Of course a lot more work goes into animating these images, but this should give you a rough idea.
