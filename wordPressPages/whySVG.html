<h3>Why should someone use Scalable Vector Graphics?</h3>
<p>Since many people have smart phones and tablets, responsive web design has become a necessity. This requires the website to change form when it is on a smaller display. SVG's are unlike JPG and PNG because they do not consist of a fixed set of dots. Instead, they consist of shapes and attributes so they can be saved in a small size. Have you ever enlarged a JPG and have it become unclear, revealing the pixels it is made up of? Well with SVG's that problem is gone.

In addition, SVG images consist of parts that can be controlled and animated. If a web designer needs a simple, clean graphic, SVG would be a better choice. Simple shapes such as icons are a perfect example. Other applications that would benefit from SVG are graphs, road maps, logos, and simple games. In short, the benefits of SVG's are scalability, smaller file sizes, editable parts, and clean design.</p>
