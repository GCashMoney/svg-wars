<p>X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled an 'X' in attack formation. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters in a number of battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.

Approximately thirty years later, a different variation of X-wing, the T-70 were used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Starfleet.</p>
